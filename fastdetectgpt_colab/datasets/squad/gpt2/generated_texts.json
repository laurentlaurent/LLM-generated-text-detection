The problem was that it wasn't possible to say whether the body would continue to exist if there was no DNA, or whether it would continue to exist if there was no DNA. In 1968, when the question was over, the Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation decided to make the answer simple and simple.\n\nThe answer was simple. It is a question that goes like this: do we think that life and death should be separated by DNA?\n\nI believe it is not only difficult to prove that, but it is even harder to prove that there is no genetic cause of death.
